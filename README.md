# What is aclib?

Aclib introduces a novel access control framework designed for knowledge graphs, named the Graph-based Authorization Framework (GAF). 
GAF leverages a query rewriting algorithm that, given a SPARQL query, an authorization policy, and a dataset, systematically restructures the input query in accordance with the authorization policy. 
The outcome is a refined query that utilizes the "FILTER NOT EXISTS" mechanism to exclude all unauthorized triples specified in the policy. Subsequently, the revised query is executed against the dataset, and only permitted data are delivered to the user.

## Input Structure

The policy File can be text file, which presents unauthorised RDF quads following the following structure:
- S  P  O  G ; whereas S is the subject, P is the property, O is the object, and G is the graph where the triple exists. 

The input query can be any SPARQL query. For now, our framework supports only the following SPARQL queries:
-  Basic Graph Patterns
-  Nested queries
-  FILTER based queries

The dataset can be a Trig file, which presents several RDF graphs .
   
## Example
Below we present a small example that shows the input and output of our framework. <br>

Input Data set: <br>

The quad pattern, entx:MRyan entx:salary ?o ?g, denies access to May Ryanâ€™s salary. Whereas,
entx:MRyan entx:worksFor ?o ?g, restricts access to information pertaining
to the people that May Ryan works for.

Input Query:  <br>

This query return the salaries of all persons. The results of this query against our dataset is shown below:   <br>

Results before applying the query rewriting algorithm:   <br>

The rewritten query filters out the salary of Ryan, which appears in the authorised policy. The resul of this query is shown below: <br>

# How to use aclib?
aclib can be used as a libray by creating a jar out of it and add it to the classpath of your client project. 
Functions such as 

## Configuration
Aclib is a maven project built on top of Java 11, Maven 3.9.1, Jena 4.7.0, and Fuseki 4.7.0.
Aclib contains a configuration.properties file where the following properties can be defined and updated:
- A data File Path
- A policy File Path
- A query Output Path
- queryType
- filters

## Use as a library
A jar file of aclib can be found under the folder target, enitled aclib-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar. In order to use the library:
- Create an Eclipse Project
- Add the jar to java build path
- Call functions ExecuteQuery and Load Settings. ExecuteQuery function can be used to execute the re-written query against a service or an in-memory database.
  
In case calling a service, with aclib we tried using Fuseki.
For that, the following steps need to be taken before calling the library functions:
1- Set jena home: https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tools/
2- Create a database by following these steps:
  - Using cmd, go to <path-to-jena>\bat, in my case, apache-jena-4.7.0
  - Run tdb2_tdbloader --loader=parallel --loc <arg1> <arg2>, where arg1 is the path for the databsed to be created, and arg2 is the path for the datafile to be loaded
  - Start fuseki server:
       - Go to Fuseki folder via cmd
       - Run the following command: java -jar <path-to-fuseki>/fuseki-server.jar --loc=<path_to_the_database> /<name_of_the_endpoint>
       - The ExecuteQuery function can take as input the following service URL: http://localhost:3030/<name_of_the_endpoint>/sparql

   
Aclib act as a query engine  with built-in access control that is built on top of Jena and SPARQL.

The jar can also be called from cmd by using the follwoing command:  <br>

java -jar aclib-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  arg1 arg2;  where arg1 is the location for the config file and arg2 is the input query.


## Update Aclib or Create your Own Jar
If you wish to update the library. You can simply open it in Eclipse, update it, build the project, and create a jar.
